  This test shows two services, each implemented using the node js framework<br>
  The services are almost identical, but show how you can have multiple applications behind nginx.<br>
  You can add multiple containers, each one with its own service implemented in any language.<br>
  Each service has its own internal URL, invisible to the external network<br>
  To see dynamic pages served by the services you may use the links below:<br>
